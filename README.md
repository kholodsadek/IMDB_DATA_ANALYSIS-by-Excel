Generate pivot tables to answer the following questions:

1. **Total Gross by Genre**
    - Create a pivot table to Sum the gross for each genre.
2. **Average IMDB Score by Director**

    - Create a pivot table to sum the profit for each country.
4. **Number of Movies per Year**
    - Create a pivot table to count the number of movies released each title_year.

## Visualization
